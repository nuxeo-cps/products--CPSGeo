CPSGeo Installation
===================

1. Extract or copy the CPSGeo product to the Zope Products directory

2. Restart Zope

3. Install the CPSGeo Product

   Create an External Method at the root of CPS.
   
     module:      CPSGeo.install
     function:    install

4. Install mapbuilder-lib into /:

   Create an External Method in / with id "install_mblib" using
   
     module:      CPSGeo.mapbuilder_installer
     function:    install_lib

   Call this method in the context of /, such as through its Test tab. This
   will produce a /mapbuilder hierarchy containing many folders of DTML
   Methods.  **TODO**: better automation of installer and use of Filesystem
   DTML Methods.

5. Visit /portal_maps/geo_map_page.
