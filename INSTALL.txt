Map Tool Installation and Setup
-------------------------------

1. Extract or copy the CPSGeo product to the Zope Products directory

2. Restart Zope

3. In a CPS site root, select "Add CPS Geo Tools". In the next form, add the
   CPS Map Tool. This creates a "portal_maps" object in the site root.

4. Download version 0.4 of the mapbuilder, http://mapbuilder.sourceforge.net/,
   lib from:
   
   http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mapbuilder/mapbuilder-lib-0.4.zip?download

   Extract into Products/CPSGeo/skins/mb to produce the following tree:

       Products/CPSGeo/skins/mb
                               demo/
                               mapbuilder/
                                         lib/
                                         ...

   Mapbuilder is a rich AJAX library for web map browsing applications. 

5. Install mapbuilder-lib into portal_maps:

   Create an External Method in portal_maps with id "install_mblib" using
   
     module:      CPSGeo.mapbuilder_installer
     function:    install_lib

   Call this method in the context of portal_maps, such as through its Test
   tab. This will produce a portal_maps/mapbuilder hierarchy containing
   many folders of DTML Methods.  **TODO**: better automation of installer
   and use of Filesystem DTML Methods.

6. Install the preliminary mapbuilder application for portal_maps:

   Create an External Method in portal_maps with id "install_mbapp" using
   
     module:      CPSGeo.mapbuilder_installer
     function:    install_demo_app

   Call this method in the context of portal_maps, such as through its Test
   tab.  This will produce a portal_maps/demo folder containing several 
   DTML Methods and a Page Template. **TODO**: better automation of installer
   and use of Filesystem DTML Methods.

7. Load the CPSGeo/skins/mb/demo/index_html.pt in Zope as 
   portal_maps/index_html.


8. Visit /portal_maps/demo/index_html.
