===================

1. Extract or copy the CPSGeo product to the Zope Products directory

2. Restart Zope

3. Install the CPSGeo Product

   Create an External Method at the root of CPS.
   
     module:      CPSGeo.install
     function:    install

4. Install mapbuilder-lib into portal_maps:

   Create an External Method in portal_maps with id "install_mblib" using
   
     module:      CPSGeo.mapbuilder_installer
     function:    install_lib

   Call this method in the context of portal_maps, such as through its Test
   tab. This will produce a portal_maps/mapbuilder hierarchy containing
   many folders of DTML Methods.  **TODO**: better automation of installer
   and use of Filesystem DTML Methods.

5. Install the preliminary mapbuilder application for portal_maps:

   Create an External Method in portal_maps with id "install_mbapp" using
   
     module:      CPSGeo.mapbuilder_installer
     function:    install_demo_app

   Call this method in the context of portal_maps, such as through its Test
   tab.  This will produce a portal_maps/demo folder containing several 
   DTML Methods and a Page Template. **TODO**: better automation of installer
   and use of Filesystem DTML Methods.

6. Load the CPSGeo/skins/mb/demo/index_html.pt in Zope as 
   portal_maps/index_html.


7. Visit /portal_maps/demo/index_html.
