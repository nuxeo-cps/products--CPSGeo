CPSGeo : Simple GIS for CPS
===========================

Author: Sean Gillies, sgillies@frii.com

Cartographic maps are extremely useful tools for analyzing and summarizing
information with a spatial component, and many CPS documents have a spatial
component: events happen at places, and reports are often concerned with
places. With the addition of a few simple properties, CPS documents can be
promoted to GIS (Geographic Information System) features. The CPSGeo product
provides a new geolocation schema for documents, and a lightweight web GIS
application for locating and displaying document features cartographically.

CPSGeo builds upon open standards for GIS interoperability such as GML, the
Geography Markup Language, and WMS, the Web Map Service specification. The
body which oversees these standards is the Open Geospatial Consortium
(http://www.opengeospatial.org).
