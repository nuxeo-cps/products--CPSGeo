Cartographic Map

**Attention**: What follows will change as the `Map` will become
CPSDocument based class.

1. Create Map

   Within portal_maps, select "CPSGeo Cartographic Map" from the
   list of objects than can be added. Within the next form, set an
   *id* and the base URL to the Web Map Service (WMS) which will
   be providing the map layers.

2. Edit Map

   Next step is to use the "Edit" tab of the new map instance to
   specify the map image format, image size, spatial reference
   system, spatial bounds, and default visible layers for the map.
   Many of these can be selected from lists obtained from the WMS.

   MapServer WMS users can paste map size and extents from their
   map files into the size and bounds form fields.

3. Test Map

   The Mapbuilder map widget requires a Web Map Context document
   from a Map. Visit the URL portal_maps/newmap/mapContext to test
   this. Substitute the id of the newly created map instance for
   "newmap".
