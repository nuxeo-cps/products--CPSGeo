ATTENTION : 

What's below will change as the `Map` will become CPSDocument based class.

1. Create Map

    Within portal_maps, select "CPSGeo Cartographic Map" from the list of
    objects than can be added. Within the next form, set an *id* and the base
    URL to the Web Map Service (WMS) which will be providing the map layers.

2. Edit Map

    Next step is to use the "Edit" tab of the new map instance to specify the
    map image format, image size, spatial reference system, spatial bounds,
    and default visible layers for the map. Many of these can be selected from
    lists obtained from the WMS.

    MapServer WMS users can paste map size and extents from their map files
    into the size and bounds form fields.

3. Test Map

    The mapbuilder map widget requires a Web Map Context document from a Map.
    Visit the URL portal_maps/newmap/mapContext to test this. Substitute the
    id of the newly created map instance for "newmap".
