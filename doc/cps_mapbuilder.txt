1. Mapbuilder Overview
======================

Mapbuilder is a library for programming GIS and mapping AJAX web applications
using XSL and Javascript. It is based upon the Sarissa library 

    http://sarissa.sourceforge.net/

A mapbuilder application consists of one or more models, associated with one
or more widgets and tools. Mapbuilder models store application state data as
an XML document. Widgets use a combination of XSL and Javascript to render the
models into HTML or images. Tools are for manipulation of the models.
 
Mapbuilder's design is described in detail at

    http://mapbuilder.sourceforge.net/mapbuilder/docs/design/index.html

1.1 Configuration File
----------------------

Models, widgets, and their association are configured by a mapbuilder
configuration file. Below is an excerpt from 

  CPSGeo/skins/cpsgeo_widgets/geo_edit_config.xml.dtml,

which configures the document geo-locating application::

    <MapbuilderConfig ...>
      <models>
        <Context id="mainMap">
          <widgets>
            <MapPane id="mainMapWidget">
              <htmlTagId>mainMapPane</htmlTagId>
            </MapPane>
            ...
          </widgets>
          <tools>
            <AoiMouseHandler id="mainAoi"/>
            ...
          </tools>
        </Context>
        ...
      </models>
    </MapbuilderConfig>

Mapbuilder maps XML objects ("Context", "MapPane", "AoiMouseHandler") to
library components in mapbuilder/lib/model, mapbuilder/lib/widget, or
mapbuilder/lib/tool. Widget output is tied to DIVs in a web page through the
"htmlTagId" property.

1.2 Loading the Configuration
-----------------------------

This configuration file is specified in

  CPSGeo/skins/cpsgeo_document/cpsgeo_document.pt

and is loaded upon load of that HTML. Once loaded, all configured models can be accessed via a global "config" object.


2. Mapbuilder Installation and Setup
====================================

The initial release of CPSGeo uses Mapbuiler 0.4 with two modifications. The
mapbuilder source must be mounted at CPSGeo/skins/mapbuilder so that a 
CPSGeo/skins/mapbuilder/lib directory exists. In
CPSGeo/skins/mapbuilder-patches are the two mods: a modified GmlPointRenderer
widget, and a new FeatureBase widget.

2.1 Installer Script
--------------------

CPSGeo/Extensions/mapbuilder_installer.py contains an install_lib() function
for loading mapbuilder and the two mods into a mapbuilder/lib folder in the
CPS root. This function should be used in a Zope External Method and called in
the context of the CPS root.


3. CPSGeo Mapbuilder Applications
=================================

CPSGeo includes two mapbuilder applications: one for document geo-location,
and another for viewing geo-located documents on a map.

3.1 Geo-location
----------------

The main HTML for this application is 

  CPSGeo/skins/cpsgeo_document/cps_geolocation_form.pt

and the mapbuilder config file is 

  CPSGeo/skins/cpsgeo_widgets/geo_edit_config.xml.dtml

This app uses three models: a Context for the main map, a Context for the
locator map, and a FeatureCollection for tracking the geo-location point.

3.1.1 Main Map Context
......................

The main map context (id="mainMap") gets its initial state from the site map
tool. The important properties of this model are its map layers, map size, and
spatial extent. Initial values of these properties are managed through the
site map tool, but afterwards are modified by the application widgets and
tools. The main map is rendered into the main HTML at the DIV with
id="mainMapPane".

3.1.2 Locator Map Context
.........................

The locator map context (id="locator") gets its initial state from a DTML skin
component "geo_locatorMap.xml", whose source is

  CPSGeo/skins/cpsgeo_standalone/geo_locatorMap.xml.dtml

It is rendered into the id="locatorMap" DIV in the main HTML.

3.1.3 Feature Collection
........................

A feature collection (id="featureCollection") acts as a buffer to store
temporary locations while we are geo-locating a document. The temp location is
rendered both onto the main map pane as a red square, and into a form field
that appears below the map pane in the main HTML.

3.2 Mapping Documents
---------------------

The main HTML for this application is 

  CPSGeo/skins/cpsgeo_document/cpsmap_document_view.pt

and the mapbuilder config file is 

  CPSGeo/skins/cpsgeo_document/cpsdoc_view_config.xml.dtml

This app uses three models: a Context for the main map, a Context for the
locator map, and a GeoRSS model for the locations, titles, and descriptions of
the documents to be mapped. The main map and locator contexts are identical to
the ones described in sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 above.

3.2.1 GeoRSS Model
..................

A GeoRSS document

    http://www.georss.org/

is used to store the state of documents to be mapped in a form that can be
easily rendered onto the map. The initial state of this model comes from the
getGeoRSSModel() skin method called in the context of a CPSGeo Map Document.
The source for that method is at

  CPSGeo/skins/cpsgeo_document/getGeoRSSModel.py

A GmlPointRenderer widget (id="pointRenderer") is responsible for rendering
items of this GeoRSS model onto the main map pane using a document icon. A
generic widget (id="printingFeatures") renders GeoRSS items into elements of a
form used to generate the print-quality map.

CPSGeo has a modified version of Mapbuilder's GmlPointRenderer which exploits
the overlib library's popup capability.
