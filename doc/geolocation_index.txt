Geolocation and Cataloging
    To rapidly find and map geolocated documents, new metadata and
    index are added. They extended CPS default metadata.

Metadata
    pos_list should be added to the catalog metadata to speed up
    the mapping of geolocated documents.

Indexing
    A new index, a FielIndex one, is added to the portal_catalog
    that holds the coordinates of a given document. This is
    available as well as metadata of the catalog search items.
