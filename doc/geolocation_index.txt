Geolocation and Cataloging

    To rapidly find and map geolocated documents, new metadata and
    index are added. They extended CPS default metadata.

Metadata

    pos_list should be added to the catalog metadata to speed up the mapping of
    geolocated documents.

Indexing

    A new index, a FielIndex one, is added to the portal_catalog that
    holds the coordinates of a given document. This is available as
    well as metadata of the catalog search items.
