Geolocation and Cataloging

    To rapidly find and map geolocated documents, new metadata and index will
    be required for portal_maps.

Metadata

    pos_list should be added to the catalog metadata to speed up the mapping of
    geolocated documents.

Indexing

    I propose that geolocated documents be tracked by a FieldIndex on the
    pos_list_dimension field. We will name this index "geolocation". This will
    allow the MapTool to find geolocated documents like::

        brains = self.portal_catalog(geolocation={'query': 1, 'range': 'min'})
