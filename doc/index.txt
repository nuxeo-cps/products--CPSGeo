Introduction
============


The CPSGeo product is aimed at geolocating and displaying
documents within the context of a map. Simple GIS (Geographic
Information Systems) capabilities are provided by three
components: a site map tool, a map widget, and a geolocation
schema for documents.

Glossary
========

Geolocation Schema
    Attaching a few new properties inspired by GML (Geography
    Markup Language) to documents as a geolocation schema can
    promote a CPS document to a GIS feature that can be displayed
    cartographically. See geolocation_schema.txt for more details.
    
Map Tool
    The site map tool, portal_maps, is used for configuration of
    base map layers and also provides the means to query the
    portal_catalog for geolocated documents. All server-side GIS
    is to be performed by portal_maps.

Map Widget
    The CPSGeo map widget provides the means to get document
    location (geolocation schema fields) from a map, and also to
    display documents overlaid on base map layers.
