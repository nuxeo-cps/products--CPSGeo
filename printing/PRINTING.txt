Printing Maps

  CPSGeo will rely on an external MapServer instance in the conventional
  non-WMS mode for printing support. We can POST document feature locations and
  titles to the MapServer for rendering on top of other map layers. This will
  require small edits to the MapServer map configuration files as described
  below.

  Once everything is configured we will request a printed map from the
  MapServer by posting the following data:

      map_web_template=cpsgeo_print_template.html
      layers=[map layers]+cpsdocs
      map_projection=init%3Depsg:4326
      map_cpsdocs_feature=new
      map_cpsdocs_feature_points=[x y]
      map_cpsdocs_feature_text=[document title]

      
Print template

  A simple printing template for MapServer is provided and may customized. Use
  of this template must be configured in the mapfile. See the cpsgeo_print.map
  file for an example of configuring TEMPLATEPATTERN.

CPS Document Map Layer

  The target mapfile will require a layer for the purpose of rendering CPS map
  documents into the printed map. Please see the "cpsdocs" layer in
  cpsgeo_print.map for guidance. It makes use of the CPS document_icon.png file
  that is defined in the attached symbols file.
